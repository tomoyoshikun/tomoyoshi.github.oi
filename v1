<h1>History of Japan</h1>

<p>Japan has a long history, with the first human habitation dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period around 30,000 BC. The Yamato clan established the first dynasty known as the Imperial Dynasty in the 3rd century AD, which ruled until 1868 AD. </p>

<h2>Ancient Japan (until 794 AD)</h2>

<p>The Jomon period from around 14,500 BC to 300 BC saw hunter-gatherer societies develop in Japan. Rice cultivation was introduced in the Yayoi period around 300 BC, which led to agricultural surpluses and population growth. The Kofun period from 300 to 538 AD saw the establishment of strong military states and the adoption of Buddhism and Chinese culture.</p>

<h2>Classical Japan (794–1185)</h2>

<p>This era saw the establishment of a imperial court based on the Chinese model in Heian-kyo (modern day Kyoto). The Heian period from 794 to 1185 AD was considered a golden age of art and literature. Lady Murasaki wrote the first novel in the world during this period called the Tale of Genji.</p>

<h2>Medieval Japan (1185–1600)</h2>

<p>Military rulers known as shoguns held power during this era. Mongol invasion attempts from China were repelled in 1274 and 1281 AD. The Ashikaga shogunate ruled from 1336 to 1573 and promoted Zen Buddhism and Japanese arts before falling into civil war.</p>  

<h2>Edo Period (1600–1868)</h2>

<p>Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun and established a dynasty that ruled from Edo (modern day Tokyo). It was a largely peaceful period characterized by stability and isolationist foreign policies. The social class system with samurai on top solidified during this period.</p>
